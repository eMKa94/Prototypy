# Prototypy

This repository contains projects modules ( schematics with PCB's layouts ).
The idea is to simply use this schematics as a hierarchical schematics in kicad projects and PCB layouts as reference.

example:

"3V_4I_ac_afe" consist of submodules "ac_i_afe" & "ac_v_afe" ( schematics ). PCB design in kicad cannot be modular so the PCB have to be designed individualy for each design.
